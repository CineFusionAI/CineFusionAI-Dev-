# 🔐 Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

At **CineFusion AI**, the **security of our users, contributors, and the open-source ecosystem** is a top priority. We are grateful to the security community — researchers, ethical hackers, and responsible developers — who help us maintain a safe, secure, and trusted video editing platform.

If you believe you have discovered a **security vulnerability**, we encourage you to report it to us **privately and responsibly**, following the guidelines below.

🚫 **Please do not open a public GitHub Issue or Pull Request** that discusses security-related information. Public disclosure of unpatched vulnerabilities may put users and contributors at risk.

  Describe what could happen if the vulnerability is exploited (e.g., privilege escalation, denial of service, data leak, RCE, etc.).

- **Environment Details**  
  Mention the affected components, OS/version, browser (if web-based), build version, or Git commit SHA.

- **Proof of Concept (Optional but Highly Encouraged)**  
  Code snippets, screenshots, logs, or demo videos that illustrate the exploit.

- **Suggested Fix (If Available)**  
  Any recommendations or code that may help us patch the vulnerability.

## 🔒 Responsible Disclosure Guidelines

We support and encourage responsible disclosure practices. To ensure a safe and constructive environment, please follow these guidelines:

## 🧠 Reporting Best Practices

To help us triage and resolve the issue efficiently:

- Use **clear, descriptive subject lines** in your email
- Mention if the vulnerability is **publicly known or unique**
- Let us know if the report is **time-sensitive** (e.g., exploits in the wild)
- Provide all reproduction materials in a single, **organized report**
- Avoid vague claims (e.g., “Your software is insecure”) — actionable, specific info helps most
